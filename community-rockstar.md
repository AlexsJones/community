First and foremost, be active in the Keptn community! We encourage you being part of the Keptn community by joining discussions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keptnProject), [Slack](https://slack.keptn.sh), and our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keptn).

  2. **Presentation**: Publicly talk about and present Keptn at a meetup/podcast/conference or similar formats - we are happy to [add your contribution here](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/resources.md).
  3. **Education**: Educate others on Keptn by either [writing a tutorial](https://github.com/keptn/tutorials), giving a workshop on how to use Keptn or similar formats.
