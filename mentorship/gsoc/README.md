# Google Summer of Code in Keptn

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global, online program focused on
bringing new contributors into open source software development.
GSoC contributors work with an open source organization on a
summer programming project under the guidance of mentors.

GSoC contributors accepted into the program receive a stipend, paid by Google,
to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Keptn project and its ecosystem.
In exchange, numerous community members volunteer as "mentors" for GSoC contributors 
to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in completing their projects.

### Joining as mentor

We welcome contributors to join the mentoring teams.
Each team, if a project is accepted,
will consist of 2 or more mentors and one student selected by the mentors 
and GSoC admins during the application reviews.

**Expectations**. Mentors are expected to be experienced in the project idea domain
and to be willing to mentor students.
We also expect mentors to be able to dedicate several hour per week during the community bonding and coding phases.
